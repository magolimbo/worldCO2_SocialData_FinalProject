<p>Our analysis starts from <strong>1900</strong>, until the present day, and considers all <strong>193 states</strong> of the world. The CO2 emissions of each state in a specific year are measured in million tonnes, or more easily, in billions of kilograms. 
This is a million of tonnes: <br /></p>
<h1 id="1000000000-kg"><em><center>1.000.000.000 kg</center></em></h1>
<p><br />
 Almost all items in the dataset used exclude emissions caused by <strong>changes in land use</strong> , i.e., they do not take into account the effects of activities such as deforestation, conversion of forests into agricultural or urban land, wetland reclamation, reforestation. This approach allows to isolate the impact of direct human activities on CO2 emissions, providing a more specific view of the trends in emissions related to industry and energy.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 19th century, the global situation was as follows:
<a href="https://postimg.cc/9r5H5n07"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sD1jSFRw/top20-co2-1901.png" alt="top20-co2-1901.png" /></a><br />
<small><em><center> Top 20 countries for CO2 emissions in 1901</center></em><small></small></small></p>

<p>It’s no surprise to see the leading positions, with the United States leading with <strong>721 million tons of CO2</strong> emitted into the air, caused by the rapid industrialization and economic expansion they were undergoing at that time. Similarly, the United Kingdom had been the first country to experience the <strong>Industrial Revolution</strong> in the 18th century, while Germany had made coal its primary source of energy after the discovery of rich <strong>deposits in the Ruhr region</strong>.
It is then crucial to note that Poland, in fourth position, was not yet a state in 1901 but was divided between the Russian Empire, the German Empire, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its 67 billion emitted tons were due to mining extraction and industrial activities carried out by the major empires.</p>

<small><em><center> CO2 emissions from 1900 to 1930</center></em><small></small></small></p>

<p>As visible in the graph above, the positive trend continues in the following two decades, and quite surprisingly, the year of the outbreak of the First World War does not represent a peak for emissions. Instead, <strong>it registers a decrease</strong> compared to the previous year. We had thought that the efforts employed for the production of war materials would have positively influenced emissions.</p>

<p>At the end of the conflict, many nations experienced economic recession or financial instability, which predictably caused a decrease in emissions. However, this rebounded quickly over the course of the decade, until <strong>the year of the Great Depression, 1929</strong>.</p>

<p>As well-known, and confirmed by the following interactive graph, the United States experienced a dramatic crisis, with CO2 emissions decreasing by almost <strong>36%</strong>. This crisis also reflected across the ocean, mainly in Germany, where emissions decreased by <strong>35%</strong>. The collapse of industrial production and the growth of social discontent contributed to the <strong>political success of the Nazi party</strong>.</p>

<p>It can be observed from the same interactive graph, if we focus solely on Germany, how Adolf Hitler’s rise to power led CO2 emissions to their historical highs, with a <strong>peak of 670 million tons of CO2 emitted in 1943</strong>, thanks to the significant expansion of steel industries, war industries, and the massive exploitation of German coal mines.</p>

<p>The war devastated all countries, but it’s particularly interesting to note how Germany’s CO2 emissions dropped from 600 million tons emitted in 1944 to 116 in 1945.</p>
<h1 id="this-represents-a-decrease-of-almost-80-in-just-one-year"><em><center>This represents a decrease of almost 80% in just one year</center></em></h1>

<p>Russia, already among the top emitters during WW2, under the leadership of <strong>Khrushchev and later Gorbachev</strong>, increased its CO2 emissions almost linearly. In 1958, it became the world’s <strong>second-largest emitter with 808 million tons</strong>, compared to the United States’ 2747 million tons. This was due to a large-scale industrialization program aimed at modernizing the economy and reaching the development level of Western countries. The analysis excludes emissions caused by agricultural collectivization policies, which led to the conversion of vast areas of land for intensive agricultural use. From 1958 to 1989, Russia maintained the silver medal in terms of emissions, increasing by 68% over those 30 years. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a drastic decline in emissions is visible in the interactive graph below, which compares Russia with China and Japan.</p>

<p>Turning to <strong>China</strong>, the graph of emission growth from the post-war period to today is almost exponential. After the war, its emissions were almost irrelevant compared to those of the major world powers, and despite its backward agricultural economy, its emissions increased over the next 30 years, probably due to population growth that went from about 550 million in 1949 to over 900 million in 1978. <strong>The real Chinese development miracle began in 1978 with Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms</strong>, which opened the country to foreign trade and investment. Integration into globalization favored China as a low-cost goods supplier, fueling exponential export growth. Foreign investment poured resources into the country, contributing to the development of infrastructure, technologies, and new industries. As visible from the interactive graph, Chinese CO2 emissions from 1978 to 1997, the year of Xiaoping’s death,</p>
<h1 id="increased-by-117"><em><center>increased by 117%</center></em></h1>
<p>The increase continues to this day, with <strong>China leading emissions in 2021</strong>, at 11 billion tons, followed by the United States with 5032 million tons, and India with 2674 million tons.</p>
