<p>For a while now, we’ve been hearing about CO2 emissions, their dangers for the future of our planet, and for us who inhabit it. Every day, a TV in the background, a radio, or a voice on the street warns us of the dangers we’re facing, of the inevitable death spiral we’ve entered, of the irreversibility of our actions on the environment. It’s become such a daily white noise that it almost doesn’t scare us anymore, its effects not yet tangibly catastrophic enough to despair our concern. <br /> Some are trying to change course and mitigate the damage. <br /> Others continue undisturbed to operate as they always have, testing the planet’s patience.</p>

<p>With this research, we aimed to answer these questions by passionately delving into the global evolution of CO2 emissions over space and time, to understand where we started from and the current situation. The research then continues in the subsequent chapters with an analysis of the factors directly influencing CO2 emissions and proceeds with a chapter dedicated to exploring external factors that indirectly affect this issue, such as global governance forms, the level of education of the population, etc., with the aim of uncovering new patterns and correlations.</p>

<p>For the curious ones, the primary dataset used for the analysis is provided by <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Our World In Data</a>, offering a vast collection of data from 1900 to the present day. Each entry in the dataset represents a country in a specific year, with information regarding population, fuels usage, CO2 emissions per capita, contribution to the global warming and many more. In addition to this extensive dataset, we relied on external sources to gather global socioeconomic data and intersect this information with that of the initial dataset, in order to obtain a more comprehensive overview capable of meeting our objectives.</p>

<p>With the hope that this analysis opens your mind and leaves you with something to ponder, as it has done for us, <br />we wish you a good read.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Project trailer, click the thumbnail to get redirected to Youtube]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Where have we been, an analysis over time</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/worldCO2_SocialData_FinalProject/jekyll/update/2024/05/02/AnalysisOverTime.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Where have we been, an analysis over time" /><published>2024-05-02T09:39:05+02:00</published><updated>2024-05-02T09:39:05+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/worldCO2_SocialData_FinalProject/jekyll/update/2024/05/02/AnalysisOverTime</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/worldCO2_SocialData_FinalProject/jekyll/update/2024/05/02/AnalysisOverTime.html"><![CDATA[<div class="flourish-embed flourish-bar-chart-race" data-src="visualisation/17641009"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<p>Our analysis starts from <strong>1900</strong>, until the present day, and considers all <strong>193 states</strong> of the world. The CO2 emissions of each state in a specific year are measured in million tonnes, or more easily, in billions of kilograms. 
This is a million of tonnes: <br /></p>
<h1 id="1000000000-kg"><em><center>1.000.000.000 kg</center></em></h1>
<p><br />
 Almost all items in the dataset used exclude emissions caused by <strong>changes in land use</strong> , i.e., they do not take into account the effects of activities such as deforestation, conversion of forests into agricultural or urban land, wetland reclamation, reforestation. This approach allows to isolate the impact of direct human activities on CO2 emissions, providing a more specific view of the trends in emissions related to industry and energy.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 19th century, the global situation was as follows:
<a href="https://postimg.cc/9r5H5n07"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sD1jSFRw/top20-co2-1901.png" alt="top20-co2-1901.png" /></a><br />
<small><em><center> Top 20 countries for CO2 emissions in 1901</center></em><small></small></small></p>

<p>It’s no surprise to see the leading positions, with the United States leading with <strong>721 million tons of CO2</strong> emitted into the air, caused by the rapid industrialization and economic expansion they were undergoing at that time. Similarly, the United Kingdom had been the first country to experience the <strong>Industrial Revolution</strong> in the 18th century, while Germany had made coal its primary source of energy after the discovery of rich <strong>deposits in the Ruhr region</strong>.
It is then crucial to note that Poland, in fourth position, was not yet a state in 1901 but was divided between the Russian Empire, the German Empire, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its 67 billion emitted tons were due to mining extraction and industrial activities carried out by the major empires.</p>

<small><em><center> CO2 emissions from 1900 to 1930</center></em><small></small></small></p>

<p>As visible in the graph above, the positive trend continues in the following two decades, and quite surprisingly, the year of the outbreak of the First World War does not represent a peak for emissions. Instead, <strong>it registers a decrease</strong> compared to the previous year. We had thought that the efforts employed for the production of war materials would have positively influenced emissions.</p>

<p>At the end of the conflict, many nations experienced economic recession or financial instability, which predictably caused a decrease in emissions. However, this rebounded quickly over the course of the decade, until <strong>the year of the Great Depression, 1929</strong>.</p>

<p>As well-known, and confirmed by the following interactive graph, the United States experienced a dramatic crisis, with CO2 emissions decreasing by almost <strong>36%</strong>. This crisis also reflected across the ocean, mainly in Germany, where emissions decreased by <strong>35%</strong>. The collapse of industrial production and the growth of social discontent contributed to the <strong>political success of the Nazi party</strong>.</p>

<p>It can be observed from the same interactive graph, if we focus solely on Germany, how Adolf Hitler’s rise to power led CO2 emissions to their historical highs, with a <strong>peak of 670 million tons of CO2 emitted in 1943</strong>, thanks to the significant expansion of steel industries, war industries, and the massive exploitation of German coal mines.</p>

<p><small><em>Russian women working in city factory in Leningrad during WWII</em><small></small></small></p>

<p>The war devastated all countries, but it’s particularly interesting to note how Germany’s CO2 emissions dropped from 600 million tons emitted in 1944 to 116 in 1945.</p>
<h1 id="this-represents-a-decrease-of-almost-80-in-just-one-year"><em><center>This represents a decrease of almost 80% in just one year</center></em></h1>

<p>Russia, already among the top emitters during WW2, under the leadership of <strong>Khrushchev and later Gorbachev</strong>, increased its CO2 emissions almost linearly. In 1958, it became the world’s <strong>second-largest emitter with 808 million tons</strong>, compared to the United States’ 2747 million tons. This was due to a large-scale industrialization program aimed at modernizing the economy and reaching the development level of Western countries. The analysis excludes emissions caused by agricultural collectivization policies, which led to the conversion of vast areas of land for intensive agricultural use. From 1958 to 1989, Russia maintained the silver medal in terms of emissions, increasing by 68% over those 30 years. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a drastic decline in emissions is visible in the interactive graph below, which compares Russia with China and Japan.</p>

<p><small>CO2 emissions of selected China, Japan Russia and India from 1945 to our days</small></p>

<p>Turning to <strong>China</strong>, the graph of emission growth from the post-war period to today is almost exponential. After the war, its emissions were almost irrelevant compared to those of the major world powers, and despite its backward agricultural economy, its emissions increased over the next 30 years, probably due to population growth that went from about 550 million in 1949 to over 900 million in 1978. <strong>The real Chinese development miracle began in 1978 with Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms</strong>, which opened the country to foreign trade and investment. Integration into globalization favored China as a low-cost goods supplier, fueling exponential export growth. Foreign investment poured resources into the country, contributing to the development of infrastructure, technologies, and new industries. As visible from the interactive graph, Chinese CO2 emissions from 1978 to 1997, the year of Xiaoping’s death,</p>
<h1 id="increased-by-117"><em><center>increased by 117%</center></em></h1>
<p>The increase continues to this day, with <strong>China leading emissions in 2021</strong>, at 11 billion tons, followed by the United States with 5032 million tons, and India with 2674 million tons.</p>

<iframe src="https://gorgeous-elk.static.domains/heatmap2021474.html" width="100%" height="700px"></iframe>

<p>Nor does it make sense to compare the leading emission states with other countries in the world. As visible in the heat map, in 2021:</p>
<h1 id="china--11336-million-tonnes"><em><center>China : 11336 million tonnes</center></em></h1>
<h1 id="us--5032-million-tonnes"><em><center>US : 5032 million tonnes</center></em></h1>
<h1 id="india--2674-million-tonnes"><em><center>India : 2674 million tonnes</center></em></h1>
<h1 id="russia--1711-million-tonnes"><em><center>Russia : 1711 million tonnes</center></em></h1>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/17800939"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>As visible from the pie chart, the results from China are incredible, as it alone is <strong>responsible for 30% of all global emissions</strong>. It emits more than Europe, South America, and Africa combined, a surprising result that makes us question the utility of implementing environmental policies and committing ourselves to respecting the environment when a single country in Asia is responsible for a third of global emissions.</p>

<p>It’s interesting, however, to relate these absolute emissions to the <strong>population</strong>, and the visualizations that arise from it are very insightful.</p>

<iframe src="https://gorgeous-elk.static.domains/qatar2021722.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

<p>As visible from the heatmap above, what stands out the most are not China and the United States, but <strong>the Arabian Peninsula</strong>, with Qatar emitting almost</p>
<h1 id="40-million-tonnes-of-co2-per-capita"><em><center>40 million tonnes of CO2 per capita</center></em></h1>

<p>compared to China’s 7.95 million and the United States’ 14.9 million. This is caused by immense reserves of oil and natural gas, which form the basis of their economy. As visible from the interactive pie chart below, emissions caused by oil and natural gas constitute <strong>97.8% of all emissions</strong> from the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

<iframe src="https://gorgeous-elk.static.domains/arabia_fuels.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

<p>Regarding the global situation, from the pie chart below, it can be clearly seen how countries are still <strong>heavily reliant on coal</strong>, which constitutes <strong>44.1% of emissions</strong> in 2021.</p>

<iframe src="https://gorgeous-elk.static.domains/world_fuels.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

<p>Finally, the dataset offers a category measuring the annual emissions of carbon dioxide from <strong>land-use change</strong>, measured in million tonnes. This category refers to emissions of carbon dioxide resulting from changes in land use. This type of emission occurs when there are changes in land use, such as deforestation, conversion of forests into agricultural or urban land, or reforestation. While emissions from fossil fuels, industries, and other industrial processes considered so far mainly derive from the combustion of carbon previously sequestered in fossil fuels, emissions from changes in land use derive from the direct conversion of vegetation and soil.</p>

<p>Visualizing a global heatmap, the results are quite different from the previous ones.</p>

<iframe src="https://gorgeous-elk.static.domains/landuseco2_global_2021599.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

<p>The countries that stand out are <strong>Brazil, Mexico, Congo, Ethiopia, and Indonesia</strong>, sadly topping the charts for <strong>intensive deforestation activities</strong> for logging, conversion of forests into agricultural land, and extraction of mineral resources.</p>

<p>Temperatures on Earth have been rising since the Industrial Revolution (1760-1840). While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities—particularly emissions of heat-trapping <strong>greenhouse gases</strong>—are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer. 
According to <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/">NASA - GISS</a> which is an ongoing study on temperature analysis, the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1° Celsius (1.9° Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since <strong>1975</strong>, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20°C per decade. 
Within this context, our analysis focuses on quantifying the specific contribution of each country of greenhouse gas emissions to this observed temperature increase. By examining the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and temperature changes over the past century, we aim to explain the extent to which human activities have influenced the Earth’s climate system.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/17792609"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>In the beginning of the 20th century, not surprisingly, United States was the leading country in terms of rising the global temperature. The US contributed with 0.04°C, which, indeed is a big part of the contribution as we saw before that the planet is getting warmer by 0.15 to 0.20°C per decade. This contribution was followed by United Kingdom, Russia and Germany, each of them contributing a 0.01°C per the year 1901.</p>

<p>How did the US contribute x4 times more than countries such as UK, Germany or Russia? Let’s dive into history…</p>

<p><a href="https://postimg.cc/14ddC0rj"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QxNrM09h/Whats-App-Image-2024-05-01-at-19-50-33.jpg" alt="Whats-App-Image-2024-05-01-at-19-50-33.jpg" /></a>
<small>Ford Motor Company’s Revolution 1913<small></small></small></p>

<p>By 1878 the United States had reentered a period of prosperity after the long depression of the mid-1870s. In the ensuing 20 years the volume of industrial production, the number of workers employed in industry, and the number of manufacturing plants all more than doubled.
The expansion of the iron and steel industry was even more impressive: from 1880 to 1900 the annual production of steel in the United States went from about 1,400,000 to more than 11,000,000 tons. Before the end of the century, <strong>the United States surpassed Great Britain.</strong></p>

<p>in the production of iron and steel and was providing more than <strong>one-quarter of the world’s supply of pig iron</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s see how the current top contributing countries have contributed to the global temperature over the years.</p>

<iframe src="https://gorgeous-elk.static.domains/temperature_change_plot.html " width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

<p>As can be seen the situation has not changed much compared to the past. All countries have followed an upward trend in contributing to the increase in global surface temperature. The US continues to lead the way with the incredible development of its industry. In addition, it is interesting to note that in 1996 Russia was overtaken by China, now the second largest contributor in terms of temperature. Why did China overtake Russia? Let’s take a look:</p>

<p><a href="https://postimg.cc/pyr7Jczj"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/qBxT0971/Whats-App-Image-2024-05-01-at-19-50-53.jpg" alt="Whats-App-Image-2024-05-01-at-19-50-53.jpg" /></a>

<p>In 1996, China surpassed Russia in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, consequently impacting global temperatures. This shift was propelled by China’s rapid industrial and economic growth during the 1990s, driven by expansion in manufacturing, construction, and energy sectors. Meanwhile, Russia’s economic transition following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 may have temporarily reduced industrial production and emissions. Additionally, Russia’s economic and political challenges during this period could have hindered its capacity to monitor and regulate emissions effectively. 
<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Kyoto-Protocol">Global shifts in energy and environmental policies, such as the impending Kyoto Protocol</a> of 1997, which imposed emission reduction targets on developed nations, may have influenced China and Russia’s emission behaviors.</p>

<p>In conclusion, currently in the year 2024, different countries and continents will adopt measures to curb the creation of greenhouse gases such as the <a href="https://www.imo.org/es/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/pages/MEPC76.aspx">Ban on heavy fuel oil in the Arctic</a> as of July 1, 2024, which states that ships may not use or transport heavy fuel oil as fuel in Arctic waters. 
But certainly, there is still a long way to go and it will be long, unfortunately, not all countries have the necessary measures in place to fight climate change. World organizations must fight together to stop the climate catastrophe and ban those who do not follow the stipulated regulations.</p>

<p>There are differences in economic level, population size, and technical level in different stages. At the same time, as a coal-dependent country, other regions have foreign dependence on coal. Then the primary factors and influence degrees of CO2 emissions in different stages and areas with different coal dependents will be various.
Given that the industrial sector is responsible for the largest share of energy consumption and environmental pollution, it is crucial to address this sector during World’s economic development process. By the way, in this section we want to focus on other factors that influence CO2 emissions. We will address this by diving in new datasets and research papers that show this evidence.</p>

<p>First o fall let’s take a look at the <strong>political regims around the world</strong>. Do the political regime of a country influece positively or negatively in the total of CO2 emissions a country produce? Let’s tak a look…
We have obtained this dataset from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/political-regime">Our World In Data</a></p>

<p>The above plot corresponds to the year 2021, which is the last year we have on the dataset. 
Let’s focus on the main countries, as for example, the US. According to our dataset the US has a electoral democracy, in which citizens have the right to choose between multi party elections. Is it better for en environment? We will look into into, but know, let’s check other relevant countries:</p>

<p>The relationship between political regimes and CO2 emissions is multifaceted (Bakaki et al, 2022). Democratic societies, with transparent decision-making processes, tend to <strong>prioritize environmental protection</strong>. However, political polarization can hinder effective climate policies. Authoritarian regimes, while making decisions without public opinion influence, may prioritize <strong>economic growth over sustainability</strong>. China, as a closed autocracy, exemplifies rapid industrialization with high CO2 emissions. Historical context, economic factors, and public awareness all shape environmental outcomes across countries.</p>

<p>Our research adds to the debate about regime type and environmental politics. Anyway, in this research we want to contrast if the political regime affects CO2 emissions but at the same time we want to contrast it with other data, for example, how many people is living in that country? Let’s see if there is a <strong>correlation between the population and CO2 emissions</strong>:</p>

<iframe src="https://gorgeous-elk.static.domains/population.html " width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

<p>As can be seen in the plot above, it is interesting to note that China has not stopped increasing its population over the years, followed by India. However, isn’t it interesting to see that the US is presented as one of the main polluters? Therefore, we can say that there is a very slight correlation between the number of people living in a country and the amount of CO2 that the country emits, however, we cannot say for sure that this is the case. For this, in future studies, we should gather data from all countries on both population and CO2 and study if the correlation really exists.</p>

<p>To sum up, our study looked at how different types of governments and population sizes affect the amount of CO2 a country releases into the atmosphere.
We found that countries with democratic governments tend to care more about protecting the environment. But sometimes, disagreements between political parties can slow down efforts to fight climate change.
In contrast, countries ruled by one person or a small group might focus more on making money than protecting the environment. For example, China, which doesn’t have democratic elections, has a lot of pollution because it’s growing its industries quickly.
Looking at population sizes, we noticed that countries with a lot of people, like China and India, often produce more CO2. But we can’t say for sure that having more people directly leads to more pollution.
In the end, our research shows that politics and population size both affect CO2 emissions, but other things like technology and public awareness also matter.</p>

<p>After having carried out the extensive analysis presented in this project, we can conclude that the global situation in terms of CO2 emissions is critical. It’s widely recognized that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world needs to urgently reduce emissions. But, how this responsibility is shared between regions, countries, and individuals has been an endless point of contention in international discussions.  This debate arises from the various ways in which emissions are compared: as annual emissions by country; emissions per person; historical contributions; and whether they adjust for traded goods and services. These metrics can tell very different stories.</p>

<p>As we have seen along the page, some continents, such as Europe and North America, are very concerned about the environment, however, continents such as Asia or Africa, perhaps because of the type of government in their countries, are less concerned about the CO2 emissions that are emitted annually. The fact that countries do not have lasting and real policies against pollution is something very worrying because the pollution that these countries produce affects each one of us globally.</p>

<p>As we have seen throughout the website, Denmark has never been presented as a major contributor of CO2 globally, maybe because of the small population of the country, but it should also be noted that the Danish population is aware of the emergency situation we are in and therefore, recycling, whether food, plastics or even clothes or bicycles is the order of the day.</p>

<p>We’re at a critical moment, like standing on the edge of a cliff, with irreversible disaster looming. Our planet is struggling under the weight of all the CO2 we’ve pumped into the air, and its ability to bounce back is weakening. Are we about to plunge into the abyss of environmental collapse? Or have we already gone too far to turn back? It’s a pressing question, but one without a clear answer. Each time we release more CO2, we edge closer to a future that might not have a way out. Time is running out for us to act together, and if we don’t, the consequences will be dire. It’s urgent that we join forces globally and take action now, before it’s too late.</p>
